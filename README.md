# journey-to-moon-hackerank
Language - C


This code solves the Journey to the moon problem using DFS[DEPTH FIRST SEARCH].

DFS requires graph to be either represented in form of adjacency matrix or adjacency list.As in hackerank in this particular problem 
some testcases have very high input values given for Number of vertices in graph like 100000. This becomes really hard to represent graph interms 
of adjacency matrix which gives segmentation fault due to usage of more memory space. So the Best and efficient way is to use ADJACENCY LIST,
